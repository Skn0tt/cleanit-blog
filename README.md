# cleanIT Blog

## Editing Content

Blog posts are located in `src/posts`.
Create a new post by copying over one of the existing posts, and adapt it as needed.
Open a Pull Request. After a couple of seconds, there'll be a comment by the Netlify Bot that links to a deploy preview, which you can use to check how your blog looks when published.

## Running locally

Clone the repository, run `npm install`, then start the development server with `npm start`.
